CSS Styling Practice — Step-by-Step Guide

Welcome to the CSS Styling Practice! In this activity, you will work with a pre-made HTML page and a “fill-in-the-blank” CSS file to practice styling elements. Follow the steps carefully, save your changes, and refresh your browser often to see the results.

Step 1 — Open the Project

Make sure your repository contains:

index.html

style.css

Open the project folder in your code editor (like VS Code).

Step 2 — Open the Files

Open index.html in your editor — do not change the HTML structure.

Open style.css — this is where you will make all your changes.

Step 3 — Work Through the CSS Fill-in-the-Blanks

Look at the style.css file.

Each CSS property has a blank (__________) that you need to fill in with a value.

Follow this general order to make it easier to see results:

body — background, font, margin

.container — background color, width, padding, border, shadow

h1 — color, text alignment, letter spacing

h2 — color, border-bottom, spacing

p — font size, line height, color

.image-box — alignment, margin

img — width, border, border-radius, shadow, hover effect

ul / li — list style, spacing

a / a:hover — color, text-decoration, hover color

Step 4 — Save and Refresh

Save style.css after filling in one or more blanks.

Open or refresh index.html in your browser to see your changes.

Observe how each change affects the page. This will help you understand cause and effect in CSS.

Step 5 — Experiment

Once you have filled in the blanks, feel free to experiment with different values:

Change colors, fonts, spacing, or borders.

Adjust the image size, shape, or shadow.

Try new hover effects.

The goal is to see how CSS properties can change the appearance of a page.

Step 6 — Commit Your Work

Check your changes:

git status


Stage your changes:

git add .


Commit your changes:

git commit -m "Completed CSS styling practice"


Push your work to GitHub:

git push

Step 7 — Optional Challenges

Change the body background to a gradient.

Make the image circular or add a drop shadow.

Center the list using text alignment.

Experiment with hover effects on links or images.

Step 8 — Reflection

At the bottom of your page or in a new section of your README.md, write one or two sentences about what you learned:

Example: “I learned that changing the border-radius of an image can completely change the look of a website.”
